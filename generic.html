							    <h4>Academic and Professional Background</h4>

								<p> As a final-year undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science at 
									the University of Johannesburg, I have developed a deep passion for problem-solving and algorithmic
									 thinking. My practical expertise spans Java, C++, and Visual Basic, fortified by hands-on experiences
									  that have equipped me with a robust skill set tailored for the tech industry. I am a team player who thrives on 
									  collaboration and learning from others.

									Since 2021, I have mentored and tutored over 100 high school students in mathematics, achieving an impressive 70% pass/distinction rate. 
									This role honed my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively and fostered a sense of accomplishment in guiding students to their
									 academic goals. Transitioning to a C++ tutor in June 2023 further enhanced my coding proficiency and refined my interpersonal skills through
									  collaborative and research-driven teaching methods.</p>
